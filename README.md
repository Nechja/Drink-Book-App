# The Drink Book App
 
I started this project to build a drink information repository for my capstone project for my software engineering degree and to memorialize the hundreds of cocktail recipes archived at my Patreon from my bar.

***This build is a working prototype.***


Things for my next build:
- Switching all DBContext calls to Async
- Build user functions for saving, faveing, and sharing drinks.
- Finish Dashboards and allow user customization.
- Finish PDF printing system.
