# The Drink Book App
 
I started this project to build a drink information repository for my capstone project for my software engineering degree and to memorialize the hundreds of cocktail recipes archived at my Patreon from my bar.


Things for my next build:
- Finish Dashboards and allow user customization.
- Finish PDF printing system.
